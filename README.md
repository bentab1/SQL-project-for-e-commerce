1. SQL Analysis Project – E-commerce
Introduction

This project demonstrates SQL analysis techniques on an e-commerce dataset. 
The goal is to answer key business questions such as top customers, top products, 
monthly revenue trends, product growth, and customer retention. The queries are designed 
to provide actionable insights for product and business decision-making.

a. Database Schema Assumptions

b. orders: (order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount)

c. order_items: (order_item_id, order_id, product_id, quantity, price)

d. customers: (customer_id, name)

e. products: (product_id, name, category)



2. Bank Reconciliation SQL Project

This page demonstrates a hands-on SQL project focused on bank reconciliation, a critical task for financial operations
and business analysis. Bank reconciliation involves comparing transaction records from two different sources—typically 
Bank A and Bank B—to ensure that all transactions are accurate, accounted for, and consistent.


a. Validate financial data by detecting mismatched or missing transactions.

b. Automate settlement processes to reduce manual errors and improve efficiency.

c. Generate actionable reports for decision-making and compliance.

d. The project uses three main tables:

e. bank_a_transactions – Records from Bank A.

f. bank_b_transactions – Records from Bank B.

g. settlement – Consolidated table tracking matched, mismatched, and pending transactions.

h. This section includes sample transaction inserts, automated settlement population queries, and practical SQL exercises to simulate real-world reconciliation scenarios.
